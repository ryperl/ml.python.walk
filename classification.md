Classification
==============

create a model that best divides or seperates our data

k nearest neighbors

Euclidean distance = $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2}$
Can look inside a radias of a point.

- downfalls
- larger the dataset the longer it runs
- scaling is not so good.

SVM is better at classification
