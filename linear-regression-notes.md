Linear Regression
=================

create a model that best fits our data

bestfit line -> but is it a goodfit line :)
correlation

looking for a relationship between x,y

if you don't have a good relationship between x,y doing Linear Regression is not going to be very beneficial

$y = mx+b$

m = slope
b = y intercept

m = $\cfrac{\overline{x} . \overline{y} - \overline{xy}}{\overline{(x)}^2 - \overline{x^2}}$

b = $\overline{y} - m\overline{x}$
